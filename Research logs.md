# Week 1
My name is Matthew Soeum, im 17 years old. I am a running start student coming out of franklin pierce high school. Im in a family of six, I am a twin and my two other brothers are also twins. I was born in Tacoma Washington but both of my parents were born in Cambodia.
My initial thoughts of Technical writing were incorrect. I came into the class with zero prior knowledge of what the class was. When we were told to write what we thought the clas was I wrote," The technicality of writing". I was thinking that the class would show me the basics in all types of writings the rights and wrongs of the writings. Then Mr Loan defined it as writing that is like instructions. Which is more applicable in the real job world like computer jobs etc. So my intitial thoughts of technical writing was completely incorrect.
When we started the process of making a github account and making a repository i founf it very confusing. This was because ive never used the website before. but with more practice im Probably going to get the hang of it hopefully. I found the whole repository and .md thing confusing. I do like the concept of the master branch and other branches. I think its very useful because you can see your own progress.
I think that the target audience for the programming historian are for students or people trying to develop an understanding on specific things. It includes things for teaching the audience and which is why its for those who want to learn. The audience for the pierce hacker is students and staff of pierce. The program provides information helpful for those. The writers publish this their media publicly because its helpful to others. People can use their information for the benefit of themselves. 
This week ive learned quite a bit. I finally learned what technical writing was haha. I somewhat learned how to use github.I may not be very good at it but im the bare minimum.I'll keep learning because this website is crucial for my success in this class.
